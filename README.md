### Description:
A chrome extension that allows a countdown to be played before a user watches a video on youtube.com, user can chose between 1 second to a minute countdown.

### Why I made this extension:
For 5 years I have been self teaching myself to play guitar, when practising to songs I would play the song via the associated youtube video. The time it took to click a video and wait for the video to start playing would only be around a second so I would struggle with getting my fingers into the correct chord positions quickly before the song played. I usually play solo so asking someone to press play for me wasn't always an option .Hence, I came up with this idea of delaying a video before it played and automatically reloading it for a hands-free experience.
